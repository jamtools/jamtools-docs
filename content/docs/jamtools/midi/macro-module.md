The Macro module exposes functionality to allow the user to configure their own MIDI devices to use a given feature of your application. This means there are no hardcoded MIDI device names in your code, so your application can be used by any user. A macro can capture unlimited mapped inputs from different instruments, so it remembers every mapping that you've had mapped to that feature, and they can be individually added/deleted by the user.

Macros can be used as primitives to compose simple or complex features. They provide a way to interact with MIDI devices, while having the feature-level code be agnostic to the MIDI device being used.

The following macro types are exposed by the Macro module:

- Inputs:
    - `musical_keyboard_input` - Receive MIDI events for a MIDI keyboard chosen by the user. This is useful for receiving tonal input from a MIDI keyboard. The stored mapping consists of the midi controller, and a midi channel. Feature-level code generally doesn't need to know these details.
    - `midi_control_change_input` - Receive MIDI events for a specific [controller change](https://cmtext.indiana.edu/MIDI/chapter3_controller_change.php) input chosen by the user, like a slider or knob. This is useful for receiving a spectrum of data from one control.
    - `midi_button_input` - Receive MIDI events for a specific MIDI controller button or note chosen by the user. This is useful for running a specific action when the given button is pressed.
- Outputs
    - `musical_keyboard_output` - Send MIDI events to a MIDI keyboard chosen by the user. This is useful for sending tonal information to a DAW or hardware synth.
    - `midi_control_change_output` - Send MIDI events for a controller change output chosen by the user. This is useful for changing things on a DAW effect like the dry/wet or intensity setting.
    - `midi_button_output` - Send MIDI events for a specific button/note chosen by the user. This is useful to send discrete messages to a toggleable setting in a DAW.

## Examples

Here is a basic "MIDI thru" example, where we simply proxy MIDI events between two MIDI keyboards chosen by the user:

```jsx
import springboard from 'springboard';

import '@jamtools/core/modules/macro_module/macro_module';

springboard.registerModule('MidiThru', {}, async (moduleAPI) => {
    // Get the Macro module
    const macroModule = moduleAPI.deps.module.moduleRegistry.getModule('macro');

    // Create macros
    const inputMacro = await macroModule.createMacro(moduleAPI, 'My MIDI Input', 'musical_keyboard_input', {});
    const outputMacro = await macroModule.createMacro(moduleAPI, 'My MIDI Output', 'musical_keyboard_output', {});

    // Subscribe to events from the MIDI keyboard(s) chosen by the user for the "My MIDI Input" macro defined above
    inputMacro.subject.subscribe(evt => {
        outputMacro.send(evt.event); // Send the same MIDI event to the configured MIDI output device
    });

    moduleAPI.registerRoute('', {}, () => {
        return (
            <div>
                <inputMacro.edit/>
                <outputMacro.edit/>
            </div>
        );
    });
});
```

We would normally do something more useful here like an arpeggio or chord extension, but for this example we are just doing a "MIDI Thru" by proxying the events from one MIDI device to another.

Instead of explicitly calling `input.subject.subscribe`, we can also use the shorthand `onTrigger` option to listen for events:

```jsx
const outputMacro = await macroModule.createMacro(moduleAPI, 'My MIDI Output', 'musical_keyboard_output', {});

const inputMacro = await macroModule.createMacro(moduleAPI, 'My MIDI Input', 'musical_keyboard_input', {
    onTrigger: (evt) => {
        outputMacro.send(evt.event);
    },
});
```

Here is an example where we extend the note pressed to be a major triad:

```jsx
const outputMacro = await macroModule.createMacro(moduleAPI, 'My MIDI Output', 'musical_keyboard_output', {});

const inputMacro = await macroModule.createMacro(moduleAPI, 'My MIDI Input', 'musical_keyboard_input', {
    onTrigger: (evt) => {
        // Send 3 MIDI events. One for each note of the triad.

        outputMacro.send(evt.event); // Send the original note pressed

        outputMacro.send({
            ...evt.event,
            number: evt.event.number + 4, // Major third interval
        });

        outputMacro.send({
            ...evt.event,
            number: evt.event.number + 7, // Perfect fifth interval
        });
    },
});
```
