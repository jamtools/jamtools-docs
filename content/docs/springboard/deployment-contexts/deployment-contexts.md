## Deployment contexts

A Springboard application can be deployed and run in multiple ways. The framework abstracts this away, so that feature-level code can be agnostic to the deployment context.

An application deployment can be  single-player-only, multi-player-only, or a hybrid where the user swaps between contexts.

### Multi-player

The framework helps facilitate realtime communication between clients behind-the-scenes using [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) and [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC#Version_2.0). By defining shared actions and states in your application, user actions are sent to the correct device to process the action, and any shared state that changes as a consequence from the action is automatically synchronized across devices in realtime.

### Single-player

In the single-player (or local-only, offline) mode, all code runs locally, and any data storage happens locally.

When the user chooses to go local-only, the browser is refreshed to process the change. This may not be a requirement in the future.
